# LUTE - Learning Using Texts

[![CI master](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/actions/workflows/symfony-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/actions/workflows/symfony-ci.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

This is a fork and ground-up rewrite of [Hugo Fara's fork](https://github.com/hugofara) of the original Learning with Texts project on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learning-with-texts).

> Lute would never have existed without the original Learning With Texts and Hugo Fara's subsequent efforts, so **a big thanks to both of these projects.**

## Demo

A _very_ brief demo, showing the core feature: reading a doc, and creating a term:

![A wee demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1637133/210660839-b9aebebc-60c6-43fc-9f6d-daf2c448f825.gif)

_(fyi - The screenshot was edited for time and file size, so it looks like Lute is automatically filling in the term form -- it's not.)_

Features not shown:

* creating/editing texts
* searching texts in the listing page
* creating multi-word terms (clicking and dragging in the reading pane)
* defining languages

The feature set of Lute is currently small, but it contains the core features for it to be a minimally viable product (MVP).  As I, or others, feel the need, new features can be implemented.

# Docs

Docs are in the [Wiki](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/wiki).  Some initial links to check out:

* Read about Lute's origin, and why I forked this project from LWT [here](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/wiki/Project-origin).
* If you're wondering whether you should use Lute or something else, [here's my take](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/wiki/Lute-alternatives).
* [Installation](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/wiki/Installation)

There are a few more notes in [the docs](./docs/README.md), but the Wiki is the best place to start.

You can also join [the Lute Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CzFUQP5m8u).

If you're a user: Lute is free :-) ... but if it makes your life better and you feel like saying thanks, I gladly accept <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jzohrab" target="_blank">coffee</a>.  I'll give thanks and will use the caffeine to implement features, or, better, recruit devs to grow the project.
