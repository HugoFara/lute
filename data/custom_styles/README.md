Place your custom styles in a file called `custom_styles.css` in this folder.  This folder is ignored by git.

The file `custom_styles.css` **must be valid CSS**, as it is picked up verbatim and inserted into the HTML.

An example:

```

/* Example: changing the text size when reading */
span.textitem { font-size: 16px; }

```
