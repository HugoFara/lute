# My working files

I'm not an Apache wizard, maybe you're not either.

This folder contains some httpd-conf files that I currently have on my machine, **that work**.  I'm not saying they're the best, but they work.  I'm posting them here as-is as a reference, in case someone finds them useful.  Don't copy-paste them into your own setup, use them as a rough guide, perhaps.

Best of luck!
