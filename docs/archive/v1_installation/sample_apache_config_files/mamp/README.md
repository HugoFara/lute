# MAMP

I don't use MAMP for dev because it can be slow to start up and to check, but I think it's good for day-to-day use.

Unlike my [Plain Apache, PHP, and MySQL (Mac)](../mac_apache_php_mysql/README.md) setup, I don't use virtual hosts for MAMP, though I'm pretty sure they're supported and easy to set up.

With this conf file, I can see my MAMP Lute running at `http://localhost:8888/`.  (It's independent of my other Apache Lute instance.)
