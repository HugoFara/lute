## Updating status

When a term is selected, you can edit its status with a keystroke:

| Key            | Set status of marked term(s) to        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 - 5          | 1 (Learning) to 5 (Learned)            |
| I              | "Ignored"                              |
| W              | "Well Known"                           |


You can also "bulk update" statuses by holding down Shift and clicking with the mouse.  All of the underlined terms will then be affected when you hit 1, 2, etc.
