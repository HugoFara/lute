# Changelog

## 2023-03-27 v1.2.0

Feature changes:

* Add automated backups (ref notes in https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/wiki/Backup).  You will be prompted to make some changes to your `.env.local` file, adding some settings as described in the wiki.

Back end (some very big changes, which simplified many sections of the code):

The changes forced some API changes which may break if your front-end Javascript is cached (in the term form of the reading pane).  Update the page a few times, and clear your javascript cache, and it should sort itself out. :-)

* Remove TextItemRepository
